# CS2235-MidTermProject-fixed-
The other mid project repo had various errors due to it being outdated compared to what was turned in

1. Create a program to simulate the card game War. (If you don’t know 
the rules to War, a video link will be posted on Moodle to explain 
them.) You may utilize the War, Card, Deck, and Player classes 
developed in class. Make sure your deck uses all 54 cards in a 
standard deck of cards. Use appropriate data structures. Use 
appropriate object-oriented programming. Finally, make use of 
methods (i.e. don’t put everything in the main).Note: Do not prompt 
the user for ANY input. Assignments submitted with prompts for 
user input will not be graded. 
a. First, create the game for two players. Print the cards as they 
are played during the game (including wars) on separate 
lines. Also, print the winner of the round on a new line.
Identify which player won (i.e. Player x has won this round, 
Player x has won the war, etc.).
b. Print the number of cards each player has left at each step
after the round winner has been declared.
c. Keep track of the number of rounds in the game and display 
this information at the end, along with which player won the 
game. The game must end only when 1 player has all the 
cards.
d. Include screenshots of a normal turn during the game, a basic 
war, a tied war and the summary of the game. 
2. In a separate file, play 1,000 games of two-player war. (It is 
recommended that you comment out your round by round print 
statements.)
